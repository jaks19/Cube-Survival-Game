# Cube-Survival-Game
A game created as I was learning programming in C# and how to use Unity3D i.e. create prefabs, assets, scenes etc I also got a taste of Graphic Design as I went and designed all the traps piece by piece using Blender (a design software).

## The game has a complete level and...
The game has a complete level that you can play through. Then, all assets were modified so they are as modular as it gets. Using those, more and more levels can be created.

## Principle of the Game
The game is a classic Pacman-Like game but where there are varieties of obstacles that need to be avoided. In the game you are a Prince and you have to save the Princess from the Evil Dark Force, while avoiding traps and collecting coins for points. You intuitively understand this when you see the [Game Interface](screenshot.png)

## To run:
Open the project folder in Unity3D and byou can run the raw version or build onto ANY platform from Android to iOS to PC to XBox. The game should be built while selecting Scene 1. 

## Building new Levels:
Scene 2 is incomplete but as explained above, all the infrastructure is there (traps, coins, characters, maze blocks) to build more levels and doing that can actually be fun. Basically building a new level would require re-arranging the maze, making traps less or more powerful, creating strategic thinking challenges to grab coins. Another level of innovation woulf be to add traps and for that maybe you have to use blender to create new assets. 
(I used this platform to go and teach my little cousin about game development on Unity and he is now helping me build more levels. He started by making a new ['Ambience'](changing_skin.png) for the game)

## File Hierarchy:
All the C# scripts, graphic assets and prefabs are in the assets folder. The game needs to be run from the highest level where the whole project is available with all the files due to weird Unity3D project settings files.
